# PopularMovies

This is the repository for the **Popular Movies** project of the Android Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.

# Building the project

Note that in order to build this project you need a custom API key from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you have created a file called *gradle.properties* in the main directoy, add the following line to it:

    TheMovieDbApiKey = "MyApiKey"
