# PopularMovies

This is the repository for the **Popular Movies** project of the Android Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.

# Building the project

Note that in order to build this project you need a custom API key from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you have one create a file called *gradle.properties* in the main directoy and add the following line:

    TheMovieDbApiKey = "MyApiKey"
